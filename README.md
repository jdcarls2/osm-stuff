# osm-stuff
Assorted files for OpenStreetMap

## imposm
I'm using imposm to import stuff to make printed maps. Idea is to be able to run this against any extract of OSM, though my primary intention is to hit the geofabrik regional files.

### goals
On the second iteration of the DB, first iteration of the printed road atlas, and I'm seeing the gaps. Things to include in the next DB rebuild:
* motorway exit numbers
* shops, though maybe not all?
* adjacent same-level atlas page labels?

## josm
Just some extra files for JOSM. Mostly just messing around.

# Townships Project

1. Load all TIGER stuff admin 6 through 8 into topology
2. Export edges
3. Use edges to create admin 7 features where missing
4. Merge and split admin ways as needed for topological integrity
5. Defer to existing data

I'm adding townships to IL and attempting to fix some of the existing TIGER boundaries.

# Sayo Device

I picked up a little Sayo 12-key hotkey pad for holding certain JOSM shortcuts. I used to use AutoHotKey, but I prefer things that aren't specific to one OS.

Using Sayo's [Web interface](https://sayodevice.com/help/std/en/web-device/), I'm able to create some of the same commands as basic JSON files that can be imported to the device. It's kind of a janky interface, tbh, but if I can figure out a better way of doing this someday, I'll be sure to document it.

This repository is to hold the configuration and scripts used to manage the device. It's not strictly OSM related, but I got the thing to use with JOSM, so I figure here's as good a place as any.
